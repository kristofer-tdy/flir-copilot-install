# Flir Copilot Installation Service

Public redirect service for installing Flir Copilot customizations in VS Code.

## What This Is

This repository contains only redirect HTML pages. When you click "Install in VS Code" 
from Flir Copilot documentation, you're directed here, and then automatically to VS Code.

No sensitive Flir content is stored in this repository.

## Privacy

The actual customization files remain in the private Flir repository. This service only 
handles the browser-to-VS Code redirect functionality.
